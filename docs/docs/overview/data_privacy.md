## Self-hosted PR-Agent

- If you self-host PR-Agent with your OpenAI (or other LLM provider) API key, it is between you and the provider. We don't send your code data to Blackbox servers.

## Blackbox Merge 💎

- When using Blackbox Merge💎, hosted by Blackbox, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, Blackbox Merge will use Blackbox’s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requests’ data — Blackbox Merge will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

## Blackbox Merge Chrome extension

- The [Blackbox Merge Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-agent-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) will not send your code to any external servers.
