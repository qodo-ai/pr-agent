# Review and Implement AI Suggestions from Your Terminal

**Blackbox Merge CLI** utilizes [Blackbox Command](https://docs.Blackbox.ai/Blackbox-documentation/Blackbox-command) to bring AI-powered code suggestions directly to your terminal.
Review, implement, and manage Blackbox Merge suggestions without leaving your development environment.
