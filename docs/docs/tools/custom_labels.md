## Overview
The `generate_labels` tool scans the PR code changes, and given a list of labels and their descriptions, it automatically suggests labels that match the PR code changes.

It can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR:
```
/generate_labels
```

## Example usage

If we wish to add detect changes to SQL queries in a given PR, we can add the following custom label along with its description:

![Custom labels list](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/custom_labels_list.png){width=768}

When running the `generate_labels` tool on a PR that includes changes in SQL queries, it will automatically suggest the custom label:

![Custom labels published](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/custom_label_published.png){width=768}

Note that in addition to the dedicated tool `generate_labels`, the custom labels will also be used by the `describe` tool.

### How to enable custom labels
There are 3 ways to enable custom labels:

#### 1. CLI (local configuration file)
When working from CLI, you need to apply the [configuration changes](#configuration-options) to the [custom_labels file](https://github.com/Codium-ai/pr-agent/blob/main/pr_agent/settings/custom_labels.toml):

#### 2. Repo configuration file
To enable custom labels, you need to apply the [configuration changes](#configuration-options) to the local `.pr_agent.toml` file in your repository.

#### 3. Handle custom labels from the Repo's labels page 💎
