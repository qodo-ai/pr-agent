## Overview
The `describe` tool scans the PR code changes, and generates a description for the PR - title, type, summary, walkthrough and labels.

The tool can be triggered automatically every time a new PR is [opened](../usage-guide/automations_and_usage.md#github-app-automatic-tools-when-a-new-pr-is-opened), or it can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR:
```
/describe
```

## Example usage

### Manual triggering

Invoke the tool manually by commenting `/describe` on any PR:

![Describe comment](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_comment.png){width=512}

After ~30 seconds, the tool will generate a description for the PR:

![Describe New](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_new.png){width=512}

If you want to edit [configurations](#configuration-options), add the relevant ones to the command:
```
/describe --pr_description.some_config1=... --pr_description.some_config2=...
```

### Automatic triggering

To run the `describe` automatically when a PR is opened, define in a [configuration file](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/usage-guide/configuration_options/#wiki-configuration-file):
```
[github_app]
pr_commands = [
    "/describe",
    ...
]

[pr_description]
publish_labels = true
...
```

- The `pr_commands` lists commands that will be executed automatically when a PR is opened.
- The `[pr_description]` section contains the configurations for the `describe` tool you want to edit (if any).

## Inline file summary 💎

This feature enables you to copy the `changes walkthrough` table to the "Files changed" tab, so you can quickly understand the changes in each file while reviewing the code changes (diff view).

To copy the `changes walkthrough` table to the "Files changed" tab, you can click on the checkbox that appears PR Description status message below the main PR Description:

![Add table checkbox](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/add_table_checkbox.png){width=512}

If you prefer to have the file summaries appear in the "Files changed" tab on every PR, change the `pr_description.inline_file_summary` parameter in the configuration file, possible values are:

- `'table'`: File changes walkthrough table will be displayed on the top of the "Files changed" tab, in addition to the "Conversation" tab.

![Diffview table](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/diffview-table.png){width=512}

- `true`: A collapsible file comment with changes title and a changes summary for each file in the PR.

![Diffview changes](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/diffview_changes.png){width=512}

- `false` (`default`): File changes walkthrough will be added only to the "Conversation" tab.

**Note**: that this feature is currently available only for GitHub.


## Markers template

To enable markers, set `pr_description.use_description_markers=true`.
Markers enable to easily integrate user's content and auto-generated content, with a template-like mechanism.

For example, if the PR original description was:
```
User content...

## PR Type:
pr_agent:type

## PR Description:
pr_agent:summary

## PR Walkthrough:
pr_agent:walkthrough
```
The marker `pr_agent:type` will be replaced with the PR type, `pr_agent:summary` will be replaced with the PR summary, and `pr_agent:walkthrough` will be replaced with the PR walkthrough.

![Describe markers before](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_markers_before.png){width=512}

&rarr;

![Describe markers after](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/describe_markers_after.png){width=512}


**Configuration params**:

- `use_description_markers`: if set to true, the tool will use markers template. It replaces every marker of the form `pr_agent:marker_name` with the relevant content. Default is false.
- `include_generated_by_header`: if set to true, the tool will add a dedicated header: 'Generated by PR Agent at ...' to any automatic content. Default is true.

## Custom labels
The default labels of the describe tool are quite generic, since they are meant to be used in any repo: [`Bug fix`, `Tests`, `Enhancement`, `Documentation`, `Other`].

You can define custom labels that are relevant for your repo and use cases.
Custom labels can be defined in a [configuration file](https://qodo-merge-docs.qodo.ai/tools/custom_labels/#configuration-options), or directly in the repo's [labels page](#handle-custom-labels-from-the-repos-labels-page).

Make sure to provide proper title, and a detailed and well-phrased description for each label, so the tool will know when to suggest it.
Each label description should be a **conditional statement**, that indicates if to add the label to the PR or not, according to the PR content.

### Handle custom labels from a configuration file
Example for a custom labels configuration setup in a configuration file:
```
[config]
enable_custom_labels=true


[custom_labels."sql_changes"]
description = "Use when a PR contains changes to SQL queries"

[custom_labels."test"]
description = "use when a PR primarily contains new tests"

...
```

### Handle custom labels from the Repo's labels page 💎

You can also control the custom labels that will be suggested by the `describe` tool from the repo's labels page:

* GitHub : go to `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/labels` (or click on the "Labels" tab in the issues or PRs page)
* GitLab : go to `https://gitlab.com/{owner}/{repo}/-/labels` (or click on "Manage" -> "Labels" on the left menu)

Now add/edit the custom labels. they should be formatted as follows:

* Label name: The name of the custom label.
* Description: Start the description of with prefix `pr_agent:`, for example: `pr_agent: Description of when AI should suggest this label`.<br>

Examples for custom labels:

  - `Main topic:performance` -  pr_agent:The main topic of this PR is performance
  - `New endpoint` -  pr_agent:A new endpoint was added in this PR
  - `SQL query` -  pr_agent:A new SQL query was added in this PR
  - `Dockerfile changes` - pr_agent:The PR contains changes in the Dockerfile
  - ...

The description should be comprehensive and detailed, indicating when to add the desired label. For example:
![Add native custom labels](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/add_native_custom_labels.png){width=768}


## Usage Tips

!!! tip "Automation"
    - When you first install Qodo Merge app, the [default mode](../usage-guide/automations_and_usage.md#github-app) for the describe tool is:
    ```
    pr_commands = ["/describe", ...]
    ```
    meaning the `describe` tool will run automatically on every PR, with the default configurations.


   - Markers are an alternative way to control the generated description, to give maximal control to the user. If you set:
   ```
   pr_commands = ["/describe --pr_description.use_description_markers=true", ...]
   ```
   the tool will replace every marker of the form `pr_agent:marker_name` in the PR description with the relevant content, where `marker_name` is one of the following:
         * `type`: the PR type.
         * `summary`: the PR summary.
         * `walkthrough`: the PR walkthrough.

   - Note that when markers are enabled, if the original PR description does not contain any markers, the tool will not alter the description at all.
