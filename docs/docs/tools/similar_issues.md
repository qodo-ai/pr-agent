## Overview
The similar issue tool retrieves the most similar issues to the current issue.
It can be invoked manually by commenting on any PR:
```
/similar_issue
```


## Example usage

![similar_issue_original_issue](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/similar_issue_original_issue.png){width=768}

![similar_issue_comment](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/similar_issue_comment.png){width=768}

![similar_issue](https://codium.ai/images/pr_agent/similar_issue.png){width=768}

Note that to perform retrieval, the `similar_issue` tool indexes all the repo previous issues (once).


**Select VectorDBs** by changing `pr_similar_issue` parameter in `configuration.toml` file

```
These parameters can be obtained by registering to [Pinecone](https://app.pinecone.io/?sessionType=signup/).
