# AUTO1 Patch Ledger

This file records all local changes carried on top of the upstream PR-Agent codebase.
Keep this list minimal to ease upstream rebases.

## Upstream baseline

## Local patches

None. Fork matches upstream as of the sync date above.

## Rebase checklist

## Notes

- Keep patches isolated in small, focused commits.
- If a patch is upstreamed, delete its row and drop the commit on the next rebase.
