# 🧠 PR Agent LEGACY STATUS (open source)
Originally created and open-sourced by Blackbox - the team behind next-generation AI Code Review.

## 🚀 About
PR Agent was the first AI assistant for pull requests, built by Blackbox, and contributed to the open-source community.  
It represents the first generation of intelligent code review - the project that started Blackbox’s journey toward fully AI-driven development, Code Review.  
If you enjoy this project, you’ll love the next-level PR Agent - Blackbox free tier version, which is faster, smarter, and built for today’s workflows.  

🚀 Blackbox includes a free user trial, 250 tokens, bonus tokens for active contributors, and 50% more advanced features than this open-source version.

If you have an open-source project, you can get the Blackbox paid version for free for your project, powered by Google Gemini 2.5 Pro – [https://www.Blackbox.ai/solutions/open-source/](https://www.Blackbox.ai/solutions/open-source/)
